# Patent Highlighter

A browser extension designed for fast patent and prior art scanning using dynamic keyword highlighting.

Built specifically for:

* Google Patents
* FreePatentsOnline
* USPTO pages
* Technical documentation
* Research articles

The extension focuses on:

* Speed
* Readability
* Workflow efficiency
* Stable DOM rendering
* Low false positives

## Match Whole Word Only

By default, keyword matching is broad.

Keyword:

```text
roof
```

Matches:

```text
roof
roofs
roofing
rooftop
```

Enable **Match Whole Word Only** to require exact word matches.

Keyword:

```text
roof
```

Matches:

```text
roof
```

Does not match:

```text
roofs
roofing
rooftop
```

This option is useful when searching for exact terminology and reducing false positives.

## How Highlighting Works

When Save is clicked:

```text
Popup
↓
sendMessage()
↓
content.js
↓
TreeWalker
↓
Highlights appear
↓
create <mark> elements
```

The highlight engine modifies the current page DOM by inserting `<mark>` elements around matching keywords.

Example:

Before:

```html
The roof contains multiple facets.
```

After:

```html
The <mark>roof</mark> contains multiple <mark>facets</mark>.
```

Highlights only exist in the current page DOM and are recreated automatically when Auto Highlight is active.

---

## Active Toggle

The Active toggle controls whether highlights are visible.

### Active ON

```text
Highlights automatically appear
on page load and refresh.
```

### Active OFF

```text
Highlights are removed
from the current page.
```

Keywords and settings remain saved.

---

## Save

Save performs two actions:

1. Stores all group settings in Chrome local storage.
2. Refreshes highlighting on the current page.

Save is the primary action users perform after editing keywords.

---

## Reset

Reset performs the following actions:

* Removes all highlights from the current page.
* Deletes all saved keywords.
* Restores default groups.
* Leaves Active enabled.

After Reset, users can immediately begin entering new keywords.

---
## Search Profiles

Patent Highlighter supports named search profiles that can be saved, exported, imported, and reused across different inventions.

### Creating a Profile

Enter a profile name such as:

```text
Roof Estimation
Medical Device
Athletic Footwear
AI Systems
Construction Materials
```

Then configure keyword groups and click Save.

### Export Profile

Export saves all profile settings to a JSON file, including:

* Profile name
* Keyword groups
* Colors
* Labels
* Auto Highlight setting
* Match Whole Word Only setting

Example:

```text
Roof Estimation.json
```

Example JSON:

```json
{
  "profileName": "Roof Estimation",
  "version": "1.2.0",
  "groups": [...],
  "autoHighlight": true,
  "wholeWordOnly": false
}
```

### Import Profile

Import restores a previously exported profile.

Imported settings include:

* Profile name
* Keyword groups
* Group colors
* Group labels
* Auto Highlight setting
* Match Whole Word Only setting

This allows researchers to quickly switch between invention specific search environments.

### Example Workflow

```text
Import Roof Estimation.json
↓
Search roofing inventions

Import Medical Device.json
↓
Search medical inventions

Import AI Systems.json
↓
Search software inventions
```

Profiles can also be shared with teammates, researchers, and trainees.

## Patent Profile Analytics

Patent Highlighter includes a floating analytics panel that appears directly on the patent page after highlighting is completed.

The panel helps researchers quickly evaluate whether a reference is worth deeper review.

### Analytics Display

Example:

```text
Patent Profile Match

Computer Vision / AI ............. 147 (37%)
Complexity / Classification ...... 125 (31%)
Roof Geometry Extraction ......... 54 (14%)
Roof Complexity Indicators ....... 30 (8%)
Estimation / Waste ............... 23 (6%)
Image Acquisition ................ 18 (4%)

Total Matches: 397
```

### Features

* Per group match counting
* Total match counting
* Percentage based analysis
* Automatic sorting by match frequency
* Group color visualization
* Draggable interface
* Position persistence across page refreshes
* Collapse and expand support
* Close button support

### Research Benefits

The analytics panel transforms keyword highlighting into a patent triage workflow.

Researchers can quickly determine:

* Which concepts dominate a reference
* Whether an invention aligns with the active search profile
* Which technical areas receive the most discussion
* Whether a patent merits detailed review

This significantly reduces time spent reviewing low relevance references.

## Architecture Philosophy

The project intentionally separates responsibilities.

### Separation of Concerns

The extension follows a modular architecture:

constants.js
    Configuration and versioning

storage.js
    Storage persistence and migrations

profiles.js
    Profile management and import/export

popup.js
    User interface

content.js
    Page analysis and highlighting

* Permissions
* Content script loading

### popup.html

Responsible for:

* Popup layout
* Buttons
* Form controls

### constants.js

Current Structure

├── DEFAULT_GROUPS
├── PRESET_COLORS
├── STORAGE_VERSIONS
└── PROFILE_VERSION

Responsible for:

Default group definitions
Preset color definitions
Storage version definitions

├── loadGroups()
├── saveGroups()
├── loadSettings()
├── saveSettings()
└── runMigrations()

### profiles.js

Current Structure

├── createProfileData()
├── createProfileBlob()
├── createProfileFileName()

## Current Features

### Search Profile Management

* Dynamic groups
* Named search profiles
* Profile import
* Profile export
* Persistent storage
* Collapse / expand groups
* Enable / disable groups
* Drag reorder groups
* Preset colors
* Custom colors

### Highlighting Engine

* Active toggle

* document.createElement("mark")

instead of:

```js
innerHTML.replace(...)
```

This avoids breaking page structure and improves compatibility with large patent pages.

* "roof waste factor"
* "machine learning"
* "semantic segmentation"
* "neural network"

Phrase matching will work alongside existing keyword highlighting.
